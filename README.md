## How Git Works course examples modified 
Paolo Perrotta (an exceptional instructor) in his course "How git works" explains the workings of git with detailed examples. In this repo is my attempt following examples we worked with in the How git works course - 1st and 2nd modules (GADS2020). Not just any kind of attempt, but SUCCESSFUL attempt! (excited). The examples have been modified and brief explanation of what i did in each commit (to help me remember). I hope to add more experiments with time.

### apple_pie.txt file commits | history:
Initial commit: Original apple_pie.txt file, no changes made to the file yet (master branch automatically created on initial commit). Lisa's version of the pie: Create lisa branch and create lisa's version of the apple_text file. Add more sugar: Changed the content of the apple_pie.txt file in the Master branch. Merge branch Lisa: Trying to merge with Lisa in master branch resulted in conflict because a change had been made to the version of the file in the master branch before the merge happened. Resolved the conflict manually, making the content of the version in the the master branch same as the one in Lisa branch and then pushed (to master). 


### README.md file commits | history: 
Add readme & first readme edit: master branch.
Lisa's version of the readme file: Created in Lisa branch.
Second merge branch lisa: Conflict again, solved.
