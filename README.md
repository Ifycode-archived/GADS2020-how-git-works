## How Git Works course
Paolo Perrotta (an exceptional instructor) in his course "How git works" explains the workings of git with detailed examples. In this repo is my attempt. The examples have been modified and brief explanation of what i did in each commit are written below (to help me remember. I may add more experiments with time). 

Commits:
Initial commit: Original apple_pie.txt file, no changes made to the file yet (master branch automatically created on initial commit).
Add more sugar: Changed the content of the apple_pie.txt file in the Master branch.
Merge branch Lisa: Trying to merge with Lisa in master branch resulted in conflict because a change had been made to the version of the file in the master branch before the merge happened. Resolved the conflict manually, making the content of the version in the the master branch same as the one in Lisa branch and then pushed (to master).
